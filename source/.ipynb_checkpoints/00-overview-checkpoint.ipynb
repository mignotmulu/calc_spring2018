    "These materials represent my Spring 2018 iteration of an introductory Calculus class, taught to undergraduates from a variety of disciplines, and varied mathematical backgrounds.   My arrangement of material is based on the historical development of Calculus, and I aim to expose students to Calculus in use through a variety of applications.  By gradually incorporating technology and the computer, we aim to support students ability to communicate and present mathematics, but also to support a larger skill set involving the use of computing technology."

We then solve these problems on the computer.  Then, we engage with deeper problems with paper and pencil, and again move them to the computer.  Finally, we investigate problems related to an application of interest to particular groups of students.\n",
