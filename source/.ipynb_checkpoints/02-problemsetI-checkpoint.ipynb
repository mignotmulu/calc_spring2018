    "The problems below come from the marvelous text *The Historical Development of Calculus* by C.H. Edwards.  You are to submit solutions with your partners, and discuss the problems openly on our Piazza board.  The suggested readings may help you with the problems.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will focus on four areas to determine the quality of solutions.  First and most important is that you are writing your solutions to a reader, and you should be considerate of using devices that help the reader understand your solutions.  The four components follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clearly State the Problem in your own words.**  You should be able to clearly and concisely explain the problem in your own everyday language.  Aim for simplicity and clarity; as if you were explaining the situation to a random person on the sidewalk.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Describe the approach to the solution.** Again, briefly and cogently describe how you solve the problem in everyday language.  Use technical vocabulary only when necessary, and again your aim is clarity and concision.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Show solution method using multiple representations: words, tables, graphs/pictures, formulas, numbers.**  These are devices to help you solve problems *and* to help you communicate your solutions to others.  Visualizations are powerful tools, use them regularly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Summarize and discuss: Look Back**.  Clearly state your solution.  Is this the only possibility?  What could have been done differently or better to solve the given problem.\n",
